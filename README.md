# Satellite Orbital Trajectory Simulation

This project simulates the trajectory of a satellite that orbits our Sun. It uses real physical calculations to accurately show what orbital pathway the satellite would take based on its initial position and initial velocity. The 3 lines represent the force of gravity from the Sun. The direction the lines are pointing in shows where the force is coming from and the length of the lines indicates how great the force is.

* Red line - force of gravity in the horizontal direction
* Blue line - force of gravity in the vertical direction
* White line - combined force of gravity from both directions

## Instructions for How to Use the Simulation
1. Run the Python file and focus your window onto the Pygame popup
2. Click anywhere on the window to add a green satellite
3. Click somewhere else on the window to set an initial velocity (further away => higher initial velocity)
4. Observe the simulation and click somewhere else to restart the satellite
